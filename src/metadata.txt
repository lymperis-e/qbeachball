description=Easily plot focal mechanisms (beachballs) onto a map. Uses the [ObsPy](https://docs.obspy.org/) library under the hood, to render beachball plots as SVG icons. The workflow is split into 2 steps: \n 
1. Beachball plots are created from a layer of events, and rendered as SVG icons. The icons are saved (by default in a folder called 'beachball_svgs' in the project directory) and named based on the selected ID field (may be an fid or an event name/identifier, but it must be unique). \n
2. A layer symbology is created, using SVG markers with a data-defined expression, to load the SVG for each event based on the selected id field/event name. \n
The user can then easily modify the symbology (e.g. change the marker size). \n\n
The data at hand, must contain the 6 moment tensor components (Mrr, Mtt, Mpp, Mrt, Mrp, Mtp) and the event location (latitude, longitude, depth). \n
You can use a CSV/TSV file ([tutorial](https://www.qgistutorials.com/en/docs/importing_spreadsheets_csv.html)) or any other vector layer (e.g. shapefile, geopackage) with the required fields. \n
The plugin was bootstraped using [this](https://rocksandwater.net/blog/2017/09/plot-focal-mechs-in-qgis/) amazing article by Richard Styron.
